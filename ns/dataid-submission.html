                    The DBpedia DataID vocabulary is a meta-data system for detailed descriptions of datasets and their different manifestations, as well as relations to agents like persons or organizations, in regard to their rights and responsibilities. Established vocabularies like DCAT, VoID, Prov-O and FOAF are reused for maximum compatibility to establish a uniform and accepted way to describe and deliver dataset metadata for arbitrary datasets and to put existing standards into practice.

        <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In 2011, the European Commission published its <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-11-1524_en.htm?locale=en">Open Data Strategy</a> defining the following <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-11-891_en.htm">six barriers</a> for “open public data”,
            reflecting pressing need for reliable dataset metadata, be it for public or commercial use:
            <ul>
                <li>a lack of information that certain data actually exists and is available;</li>
                <li>a lack of clarity of which public authority holds the data;</li>
                <li>a lack of clarity about the terms of re-use;</li>
                <li>data made available in formats that are difficult or expensive to use;</li>
                <li>complicated licensing procedures or prohibitive fees;</li>
                <li>exclusive re-use agreements with one commercial actor or re-use restricted to a government-owned company.</li>
            </ul>

            Taking these as a starting point, enriched by requirements of multiple use cases, we contrived the following short list of important aspects of dataset metadata:

        <p><strong>Provenance: </strong> A crucial aspect of data, required to assess correctness and completeness of data conversion, as well as the basis for trustworthiness of the data source (no trust without provenance).</p>
        <p><strong>Licensing: </strong> Machine-readable licensing information provides the possibility to automatically publish, distribute and consume only data that explicitly allows these actions.</p>
        <p><strong>Access: </strong> Publishing and maintaining this kind of metadata together with the data itself serves as documentation benefiting the potential user of the data as well as the creator by making it discoverable and crawlable.</p>
        <p><strong>Extensibility: </strong> Extending a given core metadata model in an easy and reusable way, while leaving the original model uncompromised expands its application possibilities fitting many different use cases.</p>
        <p><strong>Interoperability: </strong> Interoperability with other metadata models is a hallmark for a widely usable and reusable dataset metadata model.</p>

        <p>
        When regarding aspects <strong>Extensibility</strong> and <strong>Interoperability</strong>, taking into account the intricate requirements of many use cases, <strong>Extensibility</strong> and <strong>Interoperability</strong> seem contradictory when leaving the more general levels of a domain description.
        A vocabulary capable of interacting with other metadata vocabularies might be too general to fit certain scenarios of use. Restrictive extensions to a vocabulary might encroach on its ability to translate into other useful metadata formats.
        This notion is corroborated by this document on <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/Design/Interevol.html">Interoperability  and  Evolvability</a> Note: We (the authors) do not differentiate between <strong>Extensibility</strong> and <strong>Evolvability</strong>, as opposed to the author of the document discussed.
        Letting features 'die out' over time (or replacing them with new ones) does not impact, in our understanding, the aspect of <strong>Extensibility</strong> of a system.

        <h2>3. Keywords <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2>

        <p>
            The following keywords are used throughout the text without any further explanation.
        </p>
        <p>
            In general keywords like: <em class="keyword">MediaType</em> refer to an instance of the concept with the same name in the DataID core ontology.
            This is only true for concept names of this ontology! When referring to a <em class="keyword">Distribution</em>, we do mean instances of dataid:Distribution and not, for example,
            the concept with the same name in the DCAT vocabulary. There is one exception: <em class="keyword">Entity</em> refers to instances of the concept prov:Entity.
            It is generally used in the context of this document to summarize all instances of concepts in the DataID core ontology which are subclasses of prov:Entity: dataid:DataId, dataid:Dataset and dataid:Distribution.
        </p>
        <p>In some cases we abbreviate the following concept names: <em class="keyword">Role</em> is the same as <em class="keyword">AgentRole</em> and <em class="keyword">Action</em> is the same as <em class="keyword">AuthorizedAction</em>.</p>
        <p>When refering to concepts or properties itself (and not their instances), we do so by using its name together with the appropriate prefix (e.g. dataid:authorizedFor).</p>
        <p>
            There are multiple interpretations of the word/acronym <em class="keyword">DataID</em>. On the one hand we use it to refer to a metadata document,
            resulting from the appliance of the described ontology to one or more datasets, as demonstrated in the example below.
            On the other hand, <em class="keyword">DataId</em> refers to an instance of the concept dataid:DataId, meaning the entry into a dcat:Catalog or root entity of every <em class="keyword">DataID</em>.
            In conformity with the paragraph above, this difference manifests itself by the number of capital letters in the keyword (<em class="keyword">DataID</em> vs. <em class="keyword">DataId</em>).
            Additionally, DataID may also be used as a stand-in for the whole ecosystem of metadata vocabularies arranged around the ontology described in this document (see <a href="#onion">section 4</a>).
            We will abstain from this practice to prevent unnecessary confusion.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also adopted the five important aspect of dataset metadata (see <a href="#intro">section 1</a>) as keywords: <em class="keyword">Provenance</em>, <em class="keyword">Licensing</em>, <em class="keyword">Access</em>, <em class="keyword">Extensibility</em>, <em class="keyword">Interoperability</em>.
        </p>
        <p id="respecRFC2119">The keywords <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em>, <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em>, <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST NOT">MUST NOT</em>, and <em class="rfc2119" title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> are
            to be interpreted as described in [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-RFC2119">RFC2119</a></cite>].
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="div1">
        <h2 id="onion">4. Multilayer Concept<span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2>
        <p>We modularised the former DataID ontology (version 1.0.0) into a multilayer composition arranged around a single core ontology. This was necessary to preserve
            <em class="keyword">Extensibility</em> and <em class="keyword">Interoperability</em> of this ontology, as the vocabulary was growing due to a plethora of requirements of different use cases.
            While only DataID core <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> be imported into a use case specific metadata extension, many use cases may profit by importing one or more extensions (as we will see in the example in the next section).
            In general, any ontology may be used in connection with DataID core, depending on the scenario at hand. While this section does not directly describe the DataID core ontology, it serves as a backdrop, necessary to understand certain design decisons made in the core ontology.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alongside DataID core we created first extensions, to satisfy different use cases in a reusable manner. The onion-like layer model below illustrates the dependencies of the different ontologies, where an ontology of a certain layer (say 'common extensions')
            <em class="rfc2119" title="SHALL">SHALL</em> only import ontologies from layers below its own. The Statistics ontology therefore <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST NOT">MUST NOT</em> import the Linked Data extension. Authors of a common extension <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em>
            provide information about the reason for the new extension, its interoperability with other extensions of this layer as well as information on conformity with OWL profiles.
        </p>
        <img src="images/DataIDOnionMargin.png" alt="alt tag" width="800px" style="max-width:100%;" />
        <p><strong>DataID core</strong> provides the basic description of a dataset and serves as foundation for all extensions in the mid-layer or use case specificontology extensions.</p>
        <p><strong>Linked Data</strong> extends DataID core with many concepts of the VOID vocabulary and some additional properties specific to LOD datasets.</p>
        <p><strong>Activities & Plans</strong> provides provenance information of activities which generated, changed or used datasets. The goal is to record all activities needed to replicate a dataset as described by a DataID. Plans can describe which steps(activities, precautionary measures) are put in place to reach a certain goal. This extension relies heavily on the Prov-O ontology.</p>
        <p><strong>Statistics</strong> will provide the necessary measures to publish multi-dimensional data, such as statistics about datasets. This recently created ontology will be based on the Data Cube Vocabulary.</p>
        <p><strong>Other Ontologies</strong> of similar general character, which could be useful in multiple use cases.</p>
        <p>
            Deciding on which combination of DataID ontologies to use for a dataset description, is a domain and problem dependend process.
            In addition it may be necessary to add additional properties on top of the provided metadata vocabularies.
            For example; a DataID based ontology for Linked Data datasets dealing with multi dimensional data, may look schematically like this:
        </p>
        <img src="images/DataIDonionSliced.png" alt="alt tag" width="600px" style="max-width:100%;" />
        <p>Ontologies under the DataID multilayer concept do not offer cardinality restrictions, making them easy to extend and adhere to OWL profiles. </p>

        <h2 id="core">5. DataID core Ontology<span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2>
        <p>
            This section provides a concise overview of the DataID core ontology, highlighting important features together with multiple examples for a better understanding of the subject matter.

        </p>
        <p>
            For illustration purposes we will weave a running example into the descriptions of important concepts and properties.
            For this example we reduced an <a href="http://downloads.dbpedia.org/2015-10/core-i18n/af/2015-10_dataid_af.ttl">original DataID of the Afrikaans DBpedia</a>
            (release: 2015-04) to a size more easy to follow. Under the root-dataset only two sub-datasets remain. We also left out some instances referenced in the example.
            Also we neglected to list the more common properties of DCTERMS [needs link] and RDFS [needs link] like dc:title, dc:description, cd:modified, dc:issued and rdfs:label to make this example more easy to read.
            The example was constructed in a way to cover many aspects of DataID core and to provide an easy use case which could arise in a similar fashion outside this domain.
            The example is provided in full as a Turtle file at the end of this section.

            The depiction below grants an overview of this ontology, providing most of the concepts and properties which make up DataID core.
            A complete description of all concepts, properties and individuals is available in the next two sections.

        <p>
            DataID core is founded on two pillars: the DCAT and Prov-O ontologies. The base structure of DCAT (Catalog, CatalogRecord, Dataset and Distribution)
            is clearly visible in the upper part of this diagram. The class dataid:DataId subsumes
            dcat:CatalogRecord, which describes a dataset entry in a dcat:Catalog. It does not represent a dataset,
            but provenance information about dataset entries in a catalog. It is the root entity in any DataID description.
            Most general information about the DataID document and the relations to its context (e.g. to a Catalog, Repository) are entered here.

        <p>For this example we reduced an <a href="http://downloads.dbpedia.org/2015-10/core-i18n/af/2015-10_dataid_af.ttl">original DataID of the Afrikaans DBpedia</a>
            (release: 2015-04). Under the root-dataset only two sub-datasets remain.
           All distributions of the second dataset (&lt;2015-10_dataid_ar.ttl?set=interlanguage_links&gt;) are also left out, as well as some dataid:MediaType instances.
           Also we neglected to list the more common properties of DCTERMS and RDFS like dc:title, dc:description, cd:modified, dc:issued and rdfs:label to make this example more easy to read.

            <h2 id="authorizationexample">Example on Authorizations<span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2>
            <p>
                The <a href="#d4e137">dataid:Authorization</a> is one of the more complex concepts of the DataID core ontology. While properties like <a href="#d4e1438">dataid:authorizedAgent</a>
                (pointing out the Agent(s) holding an Authorization) and <a href="#d4e1148">dataid:authorityAgentRole</a> (specifying the AgentRole(s) an Agent has in the context of an Authorization)
                are easy enough to follow, <a href="#d4e1456">dataid:authorizedFor</a> with all its <a href="#authoritychainproperties">sub-properties</a> might be harder to fathom.
                For example; <a href="#d4e1311">dataid:authoritySubChain5</a> consists of a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/#Property_Chains">property chain</a> spanning over the properties <a href="#d4e1456">dataid:authorizedFor</a> and <a href="">foaf:primaryTopic</a>.
                This means, if a knowledge base (KB) holds a statement like:
            <pre><a style="color: orangered;">ex:someAuthorization</a> <a style="color: green;">dataid:authorizedFor</a> <a style="color: blue;">ex:someDataId</a> .</pre>
            and a further statement:
            <pre><a style="color: blue;">ex:someDataId</a> <a style="color: black;">foaf:primaryTopic</a> <a style="color: darkred;">ex:someDataset</a> .</pre>
            we can infer the following statement:
            <pre><a style="color: orangered;">ex:someAuthorization</a> <a style="color: green;">dataid:authorizedFor</a> <a style="color: darkred;">ex:someDataset</a> .</pre>
            The next depiction illustrates all possible inferences of <a href="#d4e1456">dataid:authorizedFor</a>, based on its subproperties dataid:authoritySubChain1-7:
            </p>
            <img src="images/AuthorizationExample4.png" alt="alt tag" style="max-width:100%;" />
            <p>
                Here the Authorization for Agent Yellow is not only valid for the DataId Entity referred to via <a href="#d4e1456">dataid:authorizedFor</a>, by inferring additional statements of this kind, the scope of this Authorization
                is extended to every Dataset and Distribution connected via foaf:primaryTopic, dcat:distribution and void:subset (note: by using the transitive super-property of void:subset, <a href="#d4e1777">dataid:transitiveSubset</a> to infer additional triples).
                By this means we can extend the influence (or scope) of an Authorization over multiple Entities without having to point out all of them with <a href="#d4e1456">dataid:authorizedFor</a>.
                Thereby we are able to define the AgentRole(s) (and consequently the Entitlements and Requirements) an Agents has in regard to different Entities within a DataID, with a minimum of RDF statements.
            </p>
            <p>
                This method has also its drawbacks, which are hereby addressed:<br/>
                By introducing multiple Authorizations in the context of a DataID, providing the same AgentRole for an Entity the author of a DataID can encounter unintended behaviours. In this example we expend the previous context by introducing an additional Agent Blue:
            </p>
            <img src="images/AuthorizationExample2.png" alt="alt tag" style="max-width:100%;" />
            <p>
                Dataset C (and all its Distributions) now has two Maintainers, both equally permitted to wield AuthorizedActions as allowed by the definition of <a href="#d4e700">dataid:Maintainer</a>. This behaviour may or may not be intended by the author.
                To provide the means for restricting Entities to specific Authorizations, we created the property <a href="#d4e1619">dataid:needsSpecialAuthorization</a>.
                This sub-property of <a href="#d4e1872">dataid:underAuthorization</a> (the inverse of <a href="#d4e1456">dataid:authorizedFor</a>) allows to point out those Authorizations with sufficient importance to exert its authority over an Entity, to the exclusion of other Authorization referred to via <a href="#d4e1456">dataid:authorizedFor</a>.
                The following example again expends the already known scenario, by introducing a third Authorization for Agent Green:
            </p>
            <img src="images/AuthorizationExample.png" alt="alt tag" style="max-width:100%;" />
            <p>
                While Dataset A and Distributions A1 and A2 are under the Authorizations of Agent Yellow and Agent Green, only Distribution A2 will be governed by both Agents. Dataset A and Distribution A1 require specifically the Authorization of Agent Green for the purpose of providing the AgentRole of Maintainer.
            </p>
            <p>
                This mechanism is useful when introducing different levels of privacy into the domain of, for example, a Document Management System (DMS). Suppose we want to specify two groups of users of our DMS:
                The first group (yellow group) should only be able to read the content of a given collection of documents, while the second group (blue group) is also allowed to modify these docments.
                Therefore we define two new AgentRoles. AgentRole 'Reader' can only read the content of Entities available to it, while the 'Editor' allows also for modifying the content.
                These roles are linked to via <a href="#d4e1148">dataid:authorityAgentRole</a> from the respective Authorizations of our two groups (<a href="#d4e1438">dataid:authorizedAgent</a> points out the members of a group).
            </p>
            <img src="images/DmsExample.png" alt="alt tag" style="max-width:100%;" />
            <p>
                Both authorizations are authorized for the same document collection (Dataset) and its Distributions as PDF and MS-Word versions of the same content in the DMS.
                Since the MS_Word version of the documents is used for editing the content, while its PDF counterpart is the publishing version,
                it is sensible to allow only the Editors (blue group) access to the MS_Word Distribution by using <a href="#d4e1619">dataid:needsSpecialAuthorization</a>.
                <br/>The existence of this statement:
            <pre>ex:distributionMsWord dataid:needsSpecialAuthorization ex:authorizationBlue .</pre>
            lets us directly infer:
            <pre>ex:authorizationBlue dataid:authorizedFor ex:distributionMsWord .</pre>
            Since <a href="#d4e1619">dataid:needsSpecialAuthorization</a> is a subproperty of <a href="#d4e1872">dataid:underAuthorization</a> which, in turn, is an inverse property of <a href="#d4e1456">dataid:authorizedFor</a> .
